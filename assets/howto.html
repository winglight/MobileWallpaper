<h1 class="entry-title">How to set a live wallpaper</h1> 
<p>Android 2.1 allows you to set live wallpapers. These are wallpapers that update with information or images without user intervention &#8211; they update automatically at regular intervals. Live wallpapers are a great way to stay on top of news or updates as they happen. Here&#8217;s how you can set live wallpapers on Android.</p> 
<p><strong>STEP 1</strong>. Tap and hold</p> 
<p>Press the home button to first go to the homescreen. On the homescreen, just tap and hold on any blank spot until a context menu appears or press the menu button.</p> 
<p><strong>STEP 2</strong>. Tap on &#8220;Wallpaper&#8221; and then &#8220;Live Wallpaper&#8221;</p> 
<p>In the menu or dialog box that showed up in STEP 1, just tap on the &#8220;Wallpaper&#8221; option, and then the &#8220;Live Wallpaper&#8221; menu item.</p> 
<p><strong>STEP 3</strong>. Select your choice of Live Wallpaper : Daily Mobile Wallpaper</p> 
<p>You&#8217;ll be presented with a selection of available Live Wallpapers. You&#8217;ll see it going through the same motions that you can expect to see as a Live Wallpaper on your Android phone. Use the back button to go back to the list of all Live Wallpapers. You can only set one Live Wallpaper at a time.</p> 
<p><strong>STEP 4</strong>. Tap &#8220;Set Wallpaper&#8221;</p>
